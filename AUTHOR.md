### Project Philosophy

*"The River"* was born from a desire to create a game that celebrates the wisdom and warmth that comes with age. In a gaming landscape often focused on youth and action, this project aims to show that the most meaningful adventures can happen when we slow down, appreciate relationships, and find joy in simple domestic pleasures like cooking and cleaning together.

The game is designed with accessibility and inclusivity at its core, ensuring that players of all ages and abilities can enjoy the cozy adventure of retirement life.

### Development Approach

This project follows a methodical, documentation-first approach to game development:

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: Detailed design documents and task breakdowns
2. **Accessibility First**: Built with accessibility considerations from the ground up
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Starting with core functionality and building up
4. **Community Focused**: Designed to foster positive, inclusive gaming experiences

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the cozy gaming community and developers of games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, and Spiritfarer for inspiring a more peaceful approach to interactive entertainment.
