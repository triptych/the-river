# The River - Game Design Ideas

## Core Concept
A cozy narrative adventure where a retired adventurer embarks on one final journey down a river, collecting fellow retirees and preparing for a grand dinner party with an old "Dark Lord" at journey's end. Success is measured by domestic skills, ingredients, and the quality of companions chosen for the boat.

## Research Insights

### Cozy Game Mechanics
- **Narrative-Driven Cooking**: Games like Venba use cooking to unlock character backstories and cultural connections
- **Companion Management**: Sakuna demonstrates how meal preparation can reveal NPC personalities and build relationships
- **Stress-Free Exploration**: Cozy games emphasize relaxation over competition, perfect for retirement themes

### Party Selection Mechanics
- **Limited Slots**: Following games like Shadowdark RPG, boat capacity creates meaningful trade-offs
- **Synergy Over Individual Power**: Lords of Xulima's emphasis on party composition over individual builds
- **Resource Sharing**: Inventory management becomes collaborative when space is limited

## Game Structure

### Act 1: Departure (Tutorial)
**Setting**: Small riverside town where the protagonist lives
- **Opening Scene**: Protagonist (customizable retired class - former knight, wizard, rogue, etc.) purchases a modest boat
- **Tutorial Mechanics**:
  - Basic cooking (making travel rations)
  - Cleaning/maintenance (boat upkeep)
  - Inventory management (packing essentials)
- **First Companion**: Meet the boat seller - a retired merchant who offers to join for "one last adventure"
- **Boat Capacity**: Starts with 4 total slots (protagonist + 3 companions)

### Act 2: The Journey (Main Gameplay Loop)
**River Segments**: 6-8 distinct areas, each with unique encounters and potential companions

#### Encounter Types:

   - Some may conflict with others (relationship dynamics)

2. **Riverside Villages**
   - Markets for ingredients and supplies
   - Local festivals or problems to solve
   - Opportunities to demonstrate domestic skills

3. **Abandoned Dungeons/Ruins**
   - Now peaceful locations with useful items
   - Former "boss monsters" now retired and friendly
   - Hidden caches of rare cooking ingredients

4. **Natural Wonders**
